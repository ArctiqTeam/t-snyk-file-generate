# Generate .snyk File from SNYK UI

This Python script fetches data from the Snyk API and generates a `.snyk` file with specific fields.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- requests library (`pip install requests`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the `script.py` file.

2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```



pip install requests

```markdown

3. Replace the placeholders in the code:
- `[org_id]` with your Snyk organization ID
- `[project_id]` with your Snyk project ID
- `[token]` with your Snyk API token

4. Run the script:
```



python script.py

```python

5. The script will make an API request to retrieve the initial text from the Snyk API and generate a `.snyk` file with the relevant information.

6. Once the script execution is complete, you will see a message indicating the successful generation of the `.snyk` file.
